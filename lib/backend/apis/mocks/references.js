      "reference": "Harshit reported to me while I was working with him in ATMECS. Harshit is a hungry man with one chopstick in his hand. Always ready to try something new. He excelled in various Server-less technologies like Lambda, Layers, SAM, Cognito, API Gateway, Amplify. He coded better in NodeJS. While Harshit was just a couple of years old, I realized that he is much more competitive compared to many experienced folks. He is a better Developer and can focus on Designing highly scalable applications. He is a good asset every manager wants to have."
